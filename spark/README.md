# Spark

Spark is a lightweight, responsive, front-end web design framework with multiple colors and styles and a little Javascript icing.

## Styles
The framework comes pre-baked with several color themes that are interchangeable.
Currently, the base colors are __silver__ (default), __blue__, __green__, __orange__, __red__, __purple__, __lime__,  __dragonfruit__ and new to v2.0: __cosmic__.

## Nonintrusive
Spark is what we like to call nonintrusive. When you include the css/js files in the head of your HTML file, by default with no extra classes it styles only the bare necessities like font families/weights/sizes/colors, resets etc. While it may require slightly more markup than other frameworks to use theme elements, it’s much easier to customize elements with the default all-in Spark rather than having to call big long selector lists to override. And that’s why we started it.

## Simplicity
The whole basis of Spark is to keep things simple. Simple to use and simple to customize. We’ve got plans to make it even simpler but let’s take things one step at a time.
